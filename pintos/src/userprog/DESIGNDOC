			   ARGUMENT PASSING
			   ================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

None

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe how you implemented argument parsing.  How do
>> you arrange for the elements of argv[] to be in the right order?
>> How do you avoid overflowing the stack page?

First we get a new page, and then copy the command line arguments entirely to
the top of the user page. 

Then, we parse the locations of the command line arguments and
place them into an array.

Then, we push the stored addresses onto the stack in reverse order.

We avoid overflowing the stacmk page by throwing an error when the
length of the command line string is larger than PGSIZE.


---- RATIONALE ----

>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?

We need a thread-safe version, as it's possible that we get interwoven calls of
strtok_r 's, which has an internal context. If we use strtok then that context gets
messed up from interwoven calls, whereas strtok_r uses another pointer
to deal with the context.

			     SYSTEM CALLS

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

syscall.c
---------

static bool show_syscall; // Shows debug messages

thread.c
--------

static struct dead_list; // A list of children that have finished (via crashing or not)

static struct file * fd_table[128]; // A table mapping FDs to file pointers.
#define FD_TABLE_LEN 128 // Length of the FD_TABLE
static struct lock fs_lock; // Lock for any filesystem or FD table interactions

thread.h
--------

enum child_status // Statuses for children threads
  {
    CHILD_ALIVE,
    CHILD_DEAD
  };

typedef struct {
  tid_t tid;
  int retval;
  char name[16];
  uint8_t invalid;
  int load_result;
} child_thread_marker;

in struct thread:

child_thread_marker children[16];
int child_count;
tid_t parent;
struct file *exec_lock;

int retval; // Return value of this thread when it calls exit

uint32_t fd_list[128]; // List of FDs for this thread
#define FD_LIST_LEN 128; // Max length of FD list

>> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.
>> Are file descriptors unique within the entire OS or just within a
>> single process?

Many FDs can correspond to one open file. File descriptors are unique
within the entire OS.

Least : 1, Most: 2  - Maybe the data is stored across two pages.

For 2 bytes, also 1 or two, in the unfortunate case one byte is at the end
of the first page and one is at the beginning of the 2nd

There is no room for improvement.

We check if the stack pointer is messed up at the top of the dispatch
table function (syscall handler). Then within each function are
the validity of arguments checked. Copying from user memory also
checks to see if the copy worked or not.

Resources are never dynamically allocated so that when thread_exit ()
is called everything gets cleared correctly.

Say...

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B7: The "exec" system call returns -1 if loading the new executable
>> fails, so it cannot return before the new executable has completed
>> loading.  How does your code ensure this?  How is the load
>> success/failure status passed back to the thread that calls "exec"?

Threads now store "load_results" of loading. The parent and child
have a relationship that makes the parent constantly yield
inside of process_execute until the child has some nonzero
status of load. In the case of -1, the child quit because
of a failure so, otehrwise the parent gets the pid.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B9: Why did you choose to implement access to user memory from the
>> kernel in the way that you did?

It forms a nice interface for the system calls. Errors with actual
copying are dealt with inside of the calls, we can deal with
errors with bad pointers outside.

>> B10: What advantages or disadvantages can you see to your design

A finite number of FDs is never a good idea.

>> B11: The default tid_t to pid_t mapping is the identity mapping.

			   SURVEY QUESTIONS
			   ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.

>> In your opinion, was this assignment, or any one of the three problems
>> in it, too easy or too hard?  Did it take too long or too little time?

A little too hard, took too long. Wait took quite a while, as did figuring out
the issues with reading and writing over multiple pages

>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave
>> you greater insight into some aspect of OS design?

Everything, this is hard, etc.

>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in
>> future quarters to help them solve the problems?  Conversely, did you
>> find any of our guidance to be misleading?

A drawing of the general idea of argument passing
would be nice. A few heads up about the larger complexity
of write/read would also be nice

>> Do you have any suggestions for the TAs to more effectively assist
>> students, either for future quarters or the remaining projects?
No.

>> Any other comments?
No.
