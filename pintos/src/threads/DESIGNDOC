---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

thread.c
--------

/* The list of sleeping threads */
static struct list wait_list;

thread.h
--------

/* Used for allowing a thread to be in the wait_list */
struct list_elem waitelem;

/* A semaphore that a thread uses to put itself to sleep */
struct semaphore timer_semaphore;

/* When a thread sleeps, it should wake up at this time relative to the kernel starting. */
int64_t wakeup_time;

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe what happens in a call to timer_sleep(),
>> including the effects of the timer interrupt handler.

We tell the current running thread to sleep for TICKS ticks. This just changes the running thread's wakeup time to be the current time + TICKS. The running thread is inserted into "wait_list" which is sorted in ascending order by wakeup time. Then, the thread is put to sleep and blocks, via sema_init and sema_down.

>> A3: What steps are taken to minimize the amount of time spent in
>> the timer interrupt handler?

We added a call to "thread.c::thread_wake_routine" , which just iterates through the sleeping threads and sees if any of them need to be woken up. This is fast and does not block.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: How are race conditions avoided when multiple threads call
>> timer_sleep() simultaneously?

The only issue is if we are interrupted when getting the return value of timer_ticks. So, we turn off interrupts as we query for the number of ticks since the kernel started, and then turn them off right after.

>> A5: How are race conditions avoided when a timer interrupt occurs
>> during a call to timer_sleep()?

We block critical sections of code by disabling interrupts. The critical sections are inside of timer_ticks() where we read the value of ticks. Since timer_sleep() also calls thread_sleep(), we also make sure to turn off interrupts when inserting the current thread into the wait_list.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A6: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?

We chose this design because it may be important in the future to be able to keep track of all sleeping threads based on their wake-up time. We initially considered not having a list of current sleeping threads and just looping through all threads of all states and updating the sleep metadata that way. That design is worse as it's both inefficient and doesn't allow an easy way to keep track of the order of threads to be woken up.

			 PRIORITY SCHEDULING

thread.c
--------

/* The following methods were declared in thread.h but defined in thread.c */

/* Helper method for both priority scheduler and MLFQS */
int get_priority(struct thread *t); /* get's the priority of the thread based on 
                                       whatever scheduler the system is set to use */

bool thread_priority_compare (const struct list_elem *a, const struct list_elem *b, void *aux); 

/* performs a priority donation from one thread to another */
void donate_priority(struct thread *source, struct thread *target);

/* This removes priority donations from a thread with respect to a lock*/
void empty_donated_priority(struct thread *t, struct lock *lock);

--------

/* This is the maxiumum depth for priority donation. */
#define DONATE_DEPTH 8

/* This represents a priority donation.  */
struct donor_elem {
  struct thread *t;      /* This is the thread that made the donation. */
  int donation;          /* This is the donation that the thread made. */

/* The following were added to struct thread */

/* Stuff for Priority Donation */
int donated_priority;         /* Maintains the highest donated priority to the thread. */
struct list donor_list;       /* Keeps a list of all donations to the thread. */
struct thread *donee;         /* Which thread that this thread has donated to. */
struct lock *waiting_on_lock; /* The lock that this thread is waiting on. */

synch.h
-------

/* added to struct lock */
struct list_elem elem; /* added so that one can maintain a list of locks*/


synch.c
------

/* This method was declared in synch.h but implemented in synch.c */
/* This compared two semaphores in a condvar.  It compares the priorities of the threads that are holding/waiting on the semaphore */
bool sema_priority_compare (const struct list_elem *a, const struct list_elem *b, void *aux);

/* Added to struct semaphore_elem */
/* Needed for condvars */
struct thread *owner; /* In a list of semaphores, this keeps track of which thread added the semaphore to the semaphore list.  This is necessary for sorting the semphores based on the priorities of their owner threads. */


>> B2: Explain the data structure used to track priority donation.
>> Use ASCII art to diagram a nested donation.  (Alternately, submit a
>> .png file.)

In order to make priority donation work, every thread maintains three things:
1) Its priority (priority)
2) The highest priority donated to the thread (donated_priority)
3) A list of all priority donations to the thread.

An entry in the priority donation

			  ADVANCED SCHEDULER
			  ==================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> C1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or

in thread.c

static int ready_list_length; //Length of the ready list
static fp_t load_avg; // load average

in thread.h::thread

int nice; // Niceness of a thread.
fp_t recent_cpu; // Recent_cpu value

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> C2: Suppose threads A, B, and C have nice values 0, 1, and 2.  Each

>> scheduling decision and the priority and recent_cpu values for each
>> thread after each given number of timer ticks:

timer  recent_cpu    priority   thread
ticks   A   B   C   A   B   C   to run
-----  --  --  --  --  --  --   ------
 0     0    0   0   31  31  31  A

>> C3: Did any ambiguities in the scheduler specification make values

- If priorities are the same to begin, which thread starts? We just use the thread at the beginning of the queue, and it does the same as ours.

>> C4: How is the way you divided the cost of scheduling between code
>> inside and outside interrupt context likely to affect performance?

- The code to update all of the parameters for MLFQS happen in external interrupt context (during the timer interrupt) so that means they are called every timer interrupt. This 
- The code to pick the next thread
